h1. eventmachine-tail

This project contains two "EventMachine":http://wiki.github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/ extensions.

First, it adds an event-driven file-following similar to the unix 'tail -f'
command. For example, you could use it to follow /var/log/messages the same way
tail -f would.

Second, it adds event-driven file patterns allowing you to watch a given file
pattern for new or removed files. For example, you could watch /var/log/*.log
for new/deleted files.

h2. Example code

For a simple file tailing example, look at "tail.rb":http://github.com/jordansissel/eventmachine-tail/blob/master/samples/tail.rb

For an example of using glob watching file patterns, look at "globwatch.rb":http://github.com/jordansissel/eventmachine-tail/blob/master/samples/globwatch.rb

For an example of using both glob watching and file tailing, check out "glob-tail.rb"http://github.com/jordansissel/eventmachine-tail/blob/master/samples/glob-tail.rb  - this project provides a glue class that helps you easily tail globs.
