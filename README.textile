h1. eventmachine-tail

This project contains two "EventMachine":http://wiki.github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/ extensions.

First, it adds an event-driven file-following similar to the unix 'tail -f'
command. For example, you could use it to follow /var/log/messages the same way
tail -f would.

Second, it adds event-driven file patterns allowing you to watch a given file
pattern for new or removed files. For example, you could watch /var/log/*.log
for new/deleted files.
